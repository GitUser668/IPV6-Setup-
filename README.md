# IPV6-Setup-
Basic IPV6 LAN Coinfiguration

Overview
This repository provides a basic guide on how to configure IPv6 in a Local Area Network (LAN) using Cisco Packet Tracer. The setup includes assigning IPv6 addresses to client devices and a router, as well as testing connectivity between clients in different LANs connected through a router (R1).

Network Topology
The setup consists of:

Router (R1): Connects two LANs and routes IPv6 traffic.

LAN 1 Clients: Devices configured with IPv6 addresses.

LAN 2 Clients: Devices configured with IPv6 addresses.

Configuration Steps

Assign IPv6 Addresses

Configure static IPv6 addresses on client devices.

Configure Router (R1)

Enable IPv6 forwarding on the router.

Verify Connectivity

Use ping6 to test connectivity between LAN clients and across LANs.

Troubleshooting

Ensure all devices have proper IPv6 addresses assigned.

Check if the router is forwarding packets between LANs.


Conclusion
This basic IPv6 setup, simulated in Cisco Packet Tracer, allows communication between client devices within and across LANs using a router. Further configurations can include DHCPv6, IPv6 security, and advanced routing protocols.
